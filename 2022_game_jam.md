## Medieval Tactics by psjuan97

- **Playing order**: 2
- **Adherence to Theme**: the cursor started acting up in the later rounds, so - maybe that was a feature? Not an enjoyable one if it was intended. Also, the game hard froze and turned off my PSP after I skipped too many rounds.
- **Creativity**: not a genre you see much of in PSP homebrews, that's for sure.
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: beautiful pixellated world map, reminds me of Populous. Too bad there's far too much blackness in the world map.
- **Soundtrack**: not bad per se, but it only loops once?
- **Clarity**: the weakest part of this homebrew. I'm thrown into the map, but what am I supposed to do with it? Selecting soldiers and moving them to 'chicken legs' (or whatever the enemies are) does nothing. Finally I managed to turn the enemies into roast, but I'm not even sure how I did it.
- **Enjoyability**

- **Playing order**: 15
- **Adherence to Theme**	
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**	
- **Soundtrack**	
- **Clarity**	
- **Enjoyability**: None, it doesn't even boot? Not even on PPSSPP? Did the creator forget to submit assets or something?

## GlitchCade by Caf√©Haine

- **Playing order**: 3 
- **Adherence to Theme**: really good use of the theme, you can tell it's not tacked on, but really the focus of the game.
- **Creativity**: it's like a glitchy WarioWare, pretty brilliant stuff!
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: maybe it's just me, but the vaporwave stuff in videogames (if that's what they were going for) really got old at this point. Graphics in the games is.. serviceable would be the word for it. Unobtrusive, but that's about it.
- **Soundtrack**: really nothing much was attempted in this department. At one point the Asteroids engine noise kept buzzing on even though I was playing the next mini game?
- **Clarity**: good. These minigames don't really need instructions
- **Enjoyability**: it kept playing the same minigame for far too long at times, which I believe was unintentional. If there were more minigames I would have kept playing, especially if there was a way to submit a highscore. 

## PSP Car Dodger by HendersonSoftworks

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021192931.png)

- **Playing order**: 4
- **Adherence to Theme**: you have to press Start each time after a game, no matter if you win or lose. Maybe that was part of the theme.
- **Creativity**: not really.
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: obviously no artists had a hand in this, but the speeding cars create a ghosting effect that is oddly pleasing and adds to the speed. No idea if this was intentional, but it definitely adds something to the department.
- **Soundtrack**: none, not even sound effects.
- **Clarity**: sure
- **Enjoyability**: nope. Crashed after trying to exit with the home button, although Irid might be to blame for that :D

## Mine, Robot! by beedge19

- **Playing order**: 20
- **Adherence to Theme**	
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: the final homebrew game of the bunch also comes with 3D graphics, nice. But after this promising beginning, the game instantly crashes as soon as I press play - very anticlimactic. 
- **Soundtrack**	
- **Clarity**	
- **Enjoyability**

## Phase by Jormii

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021230416.png)

- **Playing order**: 19
- **Adherence to Theme**	
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: something between basic and minimalistic in terms of looks, the game's strengths clearly lie elsewhere. 	
- **Soundtrack**: chimes of various pitches whenever you reach one of the tuning forks (if that's what they are). While having more sfx wouldn't have necessarily been an improvement, something of a background tune would have been welcome. 
- **Clarity**: the concept can be confusing for the non-electrical engineers among us. A bit of a textual explanation might have helped. 
- **Enjoyability**: neat puzzle-platformer, but the exact way to play it takes some time to discover.

## Buggin' Out by thegoodjakeward

- **Playing order**: 5
- **Adherence to Theme**	
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**	
- **Soundtrack**	
- **Clarity**	
- **Enjoyability**: crashed when I pressed 'Start Game'. Second attempt: another hard freeze. Probably does not work at all with a 1000 model. I understand not every dev will have 20 PSP models around, but you can set PPSSPP to 1000 mode, and it will tell you if your game goes over the available RAM...


## Glitchy PSP by luigi2498

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021190128.png)

- **Playing order**: 1
- **Adherence to Theme**: sure
- **Creativity**: it is creative, but other devs had the exact same idea so... Bonus points for having an intro dialogue though.
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: a bit of a mixed bag, some stages have 2D art with various degrees of pixellation, others are just grey blocks all around. Overall a positive impression.
- **Soundtrack**: might have stuck to the 'glitchy' theme a bit too closely, some of the tunes are a bit annoying...
- **Clarity**: seems to have trouble recognizing some inputs at times, such as jumping while running... it might be a 'feature' but one I'd rather do without in a platformer of all things.
- **Enjoyability**: average sidescroller, pretty competent but nothing really wowed me.


## PSPickr by joel16dev

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021194934.png)

- **Playing order**: 6
- **Adherence to Theme**: there is a timer no matter which option you choose, which is probably the feature
- **Creativity**: it is based on some other game...
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: it is just a bunch of square blocks	
- **Soundtrack**: just basic sound effects
- **Clarity**: the dev tells us that this is based on another game - which I'm not familiar with at all. Is this supposed to trip up color blind people?
- **Enjoyability**: it might be more fun on a device with a screen not as rubbish as the original PSP, but this wasn't much fun at all. I did keep playing it for a while, in the same way you can't put down Flappy Bird while not necessarily enjoying it.

## Crystalline by Player

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021201128.png)

- **Playing order**: 7
- **Adherence to Theme**: pressing start pauses the game only for the enemies, not the player. So there is a bit of that. But without any idea of how to play, there is no benefit from this 'glitch'.
- **Creativity**: I can't really play the game, so I don't know what the devs were going for. 
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: this is MS Paint level of crude.
- **Soundtrack**: high pitched Mario sfx at the start - and nothing else though.
- **Clarity**: having to press L/R to select levels is a bit confusing. Also I instantly got killed (which is not an issue) and the game over screen wouldn't respond to my input (which definitely is an issue).
I couldn't really understand how to play, the edges within the levels don't really seem to do anything, the enemies who are chasing me would sometimes freeze but I'm not sure what I did to make it happen.
- **Enjoyability**: getting a hard freeze with every single game over was pretty awful, I wouldn't have played it more than once if not to give it a rating. 


## Kitty Must Escape by jenneygames.com

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021063928.png)

- **Playing order**: 10
- **Adherence to Theme**: nothing that I could really notice.
- **Creativity**: first time I've seen the EasyRPG port used for anything! Being an RPG has the added benefit of having dialogues, which can add quite a bit to the experience. 
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: RPG Maker assets, can look a bit samey. 
- **Soundtrack**: pretty good background track with occasional meowing. 
- **Clarity**: It took me far too long to figure out how to get the cat out of the rooms. Then again, figuring it out is the whole point of the game!
Looking at the equipment screen - why does a cat have a long sword and cloth armor? Was this left over from another RPG Maker game?
- **Enjoyability**: It's fun just to interact with random stuff and see what the cat will say about them.


## Noodle Box! by Alex

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021225527.png)

- **Playing order**: 18
- **Adherence to Theme**: 
- **Creativity**: really good. Mixture of Snake and Tetris with a unique spin on things. I also like how every tetris piece comes with its own name. 
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: probably the most impressive of the bunch. 3D graphics without a hiccup, (mostly) untextured pastel polygons. It looks good. 
- **Soundtrack**: nothing, which is a shame given the quality of everything else. 
- **Clarity**: confusing at first - is this a Snake without the apple? But then pushing controls at random shows that the game is more ambitious than that. I'm constantly getting a large 'loss from damages' minus, I'd better figure out what I'm doing wrong. 
- **Enjoyability**: I'm definitely keeping this one on my memory stick. 


## The Balls by naskivik

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021202623.png)

- **Playing order**: 8
- **Adherence to Theme**: balls and player leave glitchy traces on screen at times... not really enough but it is something.
- **Creativity**: I haven't really seen a Java game made specifically for PSP before. Then again, you could argue there's probably a reason for it.
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: stick figures and basic geometry.
- **Soundtrack**: none.
- **Clarity**: not much to explain in this one. 
- **Enjoyability**: I don't mind button mashers where the only objective is getting a high score, but there should be a way to send a high score for bragging rights, otherwise it feels pointless very quickly.


## Founder Of Nations by IridescentRose1337

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021203359.png)

- **Playing order**: 9
- **Adherence to Theme**	
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: I never cared for the Minecraft aesthetic, but 2D sprites in a 3D environment can look good. 
- **Soundtrack**: a tune that plays once without looping, and a few sound effects and samples.
- **Clarity**	
- **Enjoyability**: technically this 3D game is obviously impressive, but the constantly stuttering framerate really detracts from the experience. I'm sure there is plenty more to this game that I haven't seen, but I don't really want to delve deeper into it, not when it runs this poorly.

## Untitled by KorigamiK

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021224734.png)

- **Playing order**: 17
- **Adherence to Theme**	
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: it is extremely basic. But unlike any other 3D game I've tried on this list so far, it doesn't feel like the engine will collapse on itself at any moment.
- **Soundtrack**: nothing past a chime on the start screen.
- **Clarity**: some sort of 3D maze? I did get a 'Congratulations' screen after a few seconds, but I'm not sure what I've done to deserve it. 
- **Enjoyability**: the environment is painful to navigate due to the poor controls. The game forces you to move the analog stick little by little to just turn around. Just going through the maze could be fun for a while, but not with these controls. 


## Strato-Naut by anashalideen

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021221910.png)

- **Playing order**: 13
- **Adherence to Theme**: I constantly get Lua runtime errors at random intervals, does that count? I'm starting to think the choice of the theme was a dubious one. 
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: the pixel art does look good on this one.
- **Soundtrack**: my god the sound on the start screen, it's literally painful. The constant buzzing continues throughout.
- **Clarity**: it does have an instructions screen, through it's written in a really tiny font. Maybe I'm just getting old. 
- **Enjoyability**


## Glitch TV by gremlinsoftware

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021222205.png)

- **Playing order**: 14
- **Adherence to Theme**: the glitchy TV certainly counts. 
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: not much here, very basic gradients as a background plus a single image for the TV. 
- **Soundtrack**: a bunch of metallic noise, just an annoyance. 
- **Clarity**: not much, from what I could tell it's just a number of quick-time events where you press L or R to hit the TV, while watching a looping game of Pong play itself. The high score doesn't even get reset after a game over screen, so there's absolutely no challenge. 
- **Enjoyability**: most of the time you're just waiting until you're prompted to press something..


## Buggy Mess by MEGAgameBoy

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021210630.png)

- **Playing order**: 11
- **Adherence to Theme**	
- **Creativity**: it's the same idea as Luigi2498's game, but I think this one pulls it off better. 
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: loved the retro XP intro. Not a fan of blocky-stick anything though, and this game does have plenty of that. It's a shame because the starting room in the game really show that the creator could really do good pixel art detail when they want to. Same with the not-Nokia phone that appears in the dialogue boxes, clearly the skills are there. 
- **Soundtrack**: nothing but sfx, but they are very well picked, and placed in the right context. 
- **Clarity**	
- **Enjoyability**: I didn't like having to skip the same cutscene every time I failed to make a jump. The platforming portion is really fun though. Pretty good humor too. Really had fun with this one, wish it was longer!


## Cowboy Coder John by Bastiaan

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021211801.png)

- **Playing order**: 12
- **Adherence to Theme**: sure, it is about fixing broken lines of code after all. 
- **Creativity**: it is certainly going for something different than the other games. 
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: it's a wall of text, which is what you'd expect given the nature of the game. The only actual bit of art I got to see was in the XMB.
- **Soundtrack**	
- **Clarity**: I couldn't figure out how to start again after getting a game over. Pressing start hard froze the PSP. 
- **Enjoyability**: you effectively just need to move the cursor with the d-pad over the red letters and press R or L to fix the typo. It's a neat and original concept, but I didn't have much fun given the way it was implemented.


## Something is going wrong! by idstudio

![Screenshot](https://github.com/pierrelouys/pages/raw/gh-pages/snaps/20221021223908.png)

- **Playing order**: 16
- **Adherence to Theme**: a bit too much. Unplayable. 
- **Creativity**	
- **Visual/Aesthetic Quality**: it does have 3D graphics though none of the objects look particularly well crafted. It does have the semblance of a small introduction. Large textured surfaces clip out of existence as you approach them.
- **Soundtrack**: none, unless something is broken in this department too.
- **Clarity**	
- **Enjoyability**: I would say it's another simple dodging game but absolutely nothing happens if you don't dodge an obstacle. Freezes very often, leaving you no choice but to restart the console.
